### Sizing

By default, icons will be sized based on the font size of the parent element.

You can set a custom size using the `size` attribute.
For multiple based sizing, pass the desired multiple followed by an `x`.

```html
<activity-icon size="1.5x" class="custom-class"></activity-icon>
```

You can also set a `px` size directly by passing an integer

```html
<activity-icon size="25" class="custom-class"></activity-icon>
```

## Note
Because [identifiers canâ€™t start with numeric literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Identifier_after_number), names beginning with have numbers converted to English words. For example, `500px` is available as `FiveHundredPxIcon`.
